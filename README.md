# RVC-restyle-vocal
Train target vocal's style and get better result.

This project is an enhanced version of the original RVC, designed to achieve improved results. By adding several steps to the conversion process, it rearranges the original singer's style to match the target singer's style. In addition to the standard RVC model, this process requires an additional model trained on the target singer's style.

(The sample uses the same RVC model.)

Currently, the generation process is complex, but we are working on a WebUI version, which will be updated in the future.
